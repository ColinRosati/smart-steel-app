DESIGN DOC

Design document for smart steel challenge 

Overview

Handle Python Backend data in front end. 

Front end visualizes sensor data using Highcharts.

Task 

Task is to create intuitive page(s) that contain informative visualizations 
of the provided data. Use HTML, JS and CSS to read the JSON and display it in an
organized way. The aim of the page(s) and visualizations should be to explore 
and understand the data for a statistical analysis.
- You may use a charting library of your choice, preferably Highcharts.
- You may use a user interface framework if you think it is necessary.
- You may change the backend python application code
- You should *not* change the task_data.csv file


Additionally, please include a simple description document where you describe:
    * your choices of libraries and frameworks (if any)
    * your choice of the design language and its influences
    * strengths of your design: What are the key points that separates your 
            design from a standard approach?
    * weaknesses of your design: What tradeoffs you had to make? What would you
            like to change for a better result?
